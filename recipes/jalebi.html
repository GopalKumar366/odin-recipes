        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jalebi is a popular Indian sweet known for its bright orange, spiral shape and irresistible sweetness.
            Made from a simple fermented batter, jalebis are deep-fried to crispy perfection and then soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup, creating a delightful contrast of textures. 
            With their crunchy exterior and juicy, syrupy center, jalebis are a favorite at festivals, celebrations, and as a indulgent treat any time of the day. Serve them warm for the ultimate melt-in-your-mouth experience!
